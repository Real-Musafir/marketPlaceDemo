          The Story of Basement Sports
        </h1>

        <p className="italic pt-1 ">
          This is a 40 year Vision, of a little kid, who is now a big kid – and
          has finally put all of the pieces together to bring to life for others
          what made his childhood magical.
        </p>

        <p className="pt-1 italic font-bold">
          Kids aren’t getting enough exercise, and youth sports has gotten too
          serious.
        </p>

        <p className="italic pt-1 ">
          Some dangerous trends are afoot in the U.S. and globally, which is the
          subject of a real, long-term health epidemic – childhood obesity,
          diabetes and other negative health indicators, which have carried on
          into adulthood as well. Further, aside from the ‘cream of the crop’,
          many kids are starting to quit hyper-competitive youth sports, due to
          a number of factors, which leading Think Tanks like the Aspen
          Institute, with the support of role models like Kobe Bryant, expose
          well in their initiative Project Play.
        </p>

        <p className="italic pt-1 ">
          Basement Sports is an answer to that need and gap in the lives of our
          children.
        </p>

        <h1 className="text-xl italic font-bold pt-3">Now Is The Time</h1>

        <p className="italic pt-1">
          While things have gotten worse health-wise for kids, and the
          advancements of technology have in some ways made it harder for them
          to ‘get off the couch’, the confluence of mobile technology,
          widespread bandwidth accessibility and stay at home scenarios (ie.
          Work from Home, Home Schooling, Quarantining for Pandemics like
          COVID-19, and Weather elements) have made it clear to us that we need
          to take action of some kind.

        <p className="italic pt-1">
          Our Founder, Arman Rousta, helped his friends launch a 501c(3)
          Non-Profit Organization called Sips & Kicks several years back, which
          is doing very good things to help kids get a healthier start in school
          through fitness and nutrition options that they didn’t have before.

          One Venture Exit Opens the Door for a New One to Open
        </h1>

        <p className="italic pt-1 ">
          Back in July 2019, when Arman headed up a successful sale of a company
          – Ajustco – he decided to make good on a vow that he had made to
          himself over 15 years back…that when he sold his next company, he
          would finally start Basement Sports. The day after the Ajustco sale,
          he gathered up his core team and began charting their course. They
          used some of the proceeds from the exit to get the App and Product
          development started. In October 2019, the Blueliner Office League
          began, to test drive the alpha version of the App, as well as the
          actual toy products. Here’s a short video highlight reel from the
          first ever Basement Sports corporate league, which we hosted at our
          Lab in Jersey City. It was loads of fun for the Big Kids!

          In May 2020, we brought this concept to the world, implementing a
          phased roll-out that started with America’s Pastime, Baseball. Soccer
          and Hockey were quick to follow, and Basketball is next up!

        <p className="italic pt-5 ">
          Our parent company – b.labs Ventures – has already invested over
          $200,000 in getting Basement Baseball ready for its introduction to
          the market. And they are standing behind us to support the launch
          marketing as well.

        <p className="italic pt-3 ">
          Our team is all-in on this game-changing idea, and we love the idea of
          having our fans and customers as co-owners at the early stage, where
          the greatest opportunity for growth and a sense of meaningful
          contribution lies.
